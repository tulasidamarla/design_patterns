## Singleton
- This pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single 
  instance. Examples include PropertyReader, Logger, DataSource etc.
- Utility classes are generally created singleton as their 
  behavior don't change based on instance.
- Steps to create a singleton are as follows.
  - Declare the constructor as private.
  - Declare a static member field of the same class type.
  - Declare a static method to create and return the singleton.
- Here is the code for singleton using above steps.
```java
public class DateUtil {
    private static DateUtil instance;
    private DateUtil(){
    }
    public static DateUtil getInstance(){
        if (instance == null){
            instance = new DateUtil();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
- `Note:` we can also create singleton eagerly, with instance variable or with 
  static blocks.
```java
private static DateUtil instance = new DateUtil();
```
```java
private static DateUtil instance;

static{
    instance = new DateUtil()
}
```

- Here is an example UML diagram of singleton.

## Singleton in multi-threaded environment
- With lazy initialization to avoid creating multiple instances use 
  synchronized method or block as shown below.
```java
public static DateUtil getInstance(){
    synchronized(DateUtil.class){
        if (instance == null){
            instance = new DateUtil();
        }
    }
    return instance;
}
```
- To improve further in multi-threaded environment, make instance variable 
  volatile so that reads are not cached and also use synchronized only when instance is null to improve performance.
```java
    private static volatile DateUtil instance;
    private DateUtil(){}
    public static DateUtil getInstance(){
        if(instance == null){
            synchronized(DateUtil.class){
                if (instance == null){
                    instance = new DateUtil();
                }    
            }    
        }
        return instance;
    }
```

## Serialization and Singleton
- Serialization writes an object to an output stream and creates a new object.
- To try this make the DateUtil class implement `java.io.Serializable` and 
  write the below test class to test.

```java
DateUtil instance1 = DateUtil.getInstance();
        DateUtil instance2;
        try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("dateutil.ser"));
        ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("dateutil.ser"))){
            oos.writeObject(instance1);
            instance2 = (DateUtil) ois.readObject();
        }
        System.out.println(instance1 == instance2);
```
- The above test returns false. To fix this, implement readResolve() method as 
  shown below, so that during de-serialization this method is invoked.
```java
private Object readResolve(){
        return instance;
}
```
- `Note:` We can use protected/public access modifier with readResolve() if 
  child classes needs to override.

## Singleton and Clone
- If a child class or external class clones a Singleton using clone() method, 
  it creates a new instance. 
```java
public class DateUtil implements Cloneable{
    private static volatile DateUtil instance;
    private DateUtil(){}
    public static DateUtil getInstance(){
        if(instance == null){
            synchronized(DateUtil.class){
                if (instance == null){
                    instance = new DateUtil();
                }    
            }    
        }
        return instance;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException{
        return super.clone();
    }
}
// Test code
DateUtil instance1 = DateUtil.getInstance();
DateUtil instance3 = (DateUtil) instance1.clone();
System.out.println(instance1 == instance3); // return false
```  
- To avoid this, override clone() method and throw clone not supported 
  exception or return the singleton instance.

## Singleton and Reflection
- Using Reflection singleton can be broken. Here is an example.
```java
DateUtil instance4 = null;
Constructor[] constructs = DateUtil.class.getConstructors();
for (Constructor constructor : constructs) {
    constructor.setAccessible(true);
    instance4 = (DateUtil) constructor.newInstance();
}
System.out.println(instance1 == instance4); // returns false
```
- To fix reflection attack, the only way is to use Enum.
- Enum doesn't provide any constructors even with Reflection.
```java
public enum DateUtil{
    INSTANCE;
}
```
