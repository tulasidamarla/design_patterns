# Design_patterns
- Design patterns are are reusable solutions to common problems encountered during software design.
- Characteristics of design patterns are as follows.
  - `Proven Solutions:` These are known approaches that have been successfully used in various projects, so time and effort can be saved.
  - `Flexibility:` These can be adapted and customized to fit the specific context of your project.
  - `Communication Tools:` These provide a common vocabulary for developers to discuss and understand design concepts. For ex, when using 
    terms like `singleton`,`prototype` every developer understands.
 - `Types of Design Patterns:`
   - `Creational Patterns:` These patterns focus on object 
     creation mechanisms. They are Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder and Prototype.
   - `Structural Patterns:` These patterns deal with the 
     composition of classes and objects, promoting a more flexible and efficient structure. Examples include, 
     - `Adapter:` Allowing incompatible interfaces to work together
     - `Facade:` Providing a simplified interface to a complex system.
     - `Decorator:` Dynamically adding new functionality to objects.
   - `Behavioral Patterns:` These patterns address how objects interact and communicate, influencing the program's behavior.
     - `Observer:` establishing a one-to-many dependency between objects.
     - `Strategy:` Allowing dynamic selection of an algorithm.
     - `Command:` Encapsulating a request as an object.
- By using design patterns, the following can be achieved.
  - `Write cleaner, more maintainable code:` Design patterns promote a well-organized and modular code structure.
  - `Improve code reusability:` You can leverage existing patterns across different parts of your code or even in new projects.
  - `Enhance communication with other developers:` Design patterns provide a common language for discussing design decisions.
  - `Solve common problems efficiently:` By using established and proven solutions, you can save time and effort.     

# Behavioral vs Structural design pattern
- Behavioral design patterns are concerned with the interaction and communication between objects and classes. 
  - They focus on how objects collaborate to fulfill responsibilities and manage relationships at runtime. 
  - These patterns are primarily concerned with algorithms, responsibilities, and communication between objects.
  - Key characteristics:
    - `Focus on Object Interaction:` Behavioral patterns focus on defining how objects interact and communicate with each other to 
      accomplish tasks.
    - `Encapsulating Behavior:` They encapsulate algorithms or behavior in objects and promote flexibility and reuse by decoupling the 
      implementation from the client code.
    - `Runtime Behavior:` Behavioral patterns are concerned with the behavior of objects at runtime and how they respond to different 
      situations or events.
    - `Dynamic Relationships:` They often involve dynamic relationships between objects that can change at runtime.
- Structural design patterns are concerned with the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures or systems.
  - They focus on organizing and structuring classes to ensure that the system is scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to change.
  - These patterns are primarily concerned with class composition, relationships, and structure.
  - Key characteristics:
    - `Focus on Class Composition:` Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures or systems.
    - `Creating Class Relationships:` They define ways to establish relationships between classes and objects to achieve specific goals, 
      such as code reuse, flexibility, or performance optimization.
    - `Static Structure:` Structural patterns primarily deal with the static structure of classes and objects rather than their runtime   
      behavior.
    - `Code Reuse and Organization:` They promote code reuse, modularity, and organization by defining common ways to structure classes and 
      objects.
