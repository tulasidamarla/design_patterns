# Design_patterns
- Design patterns are are reusable solutions to common problems 
  encountered during software design.
- Characteristics of design patterns are as follows.
  - `Proven Solutions:` These are established approaches that have 
    been successfully used in various projects, so time and effort can be saved.  
  - `Flexibility:` These can be adapted and customized to fit the 
    specific context of your project.
  - `Communication Tools:` These provide a common vocabulary for 
    developers to discuss and understand design concepts. For ex, when using terms like `singleton`,`prototype` every developer understands.
 - `Types of Design Patterns:`
   - `Creational Patterns:` These patterns focus on object 
     creation mechanisms. They are Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder and Prototype.
   - `Structural Patterns:` These patterns deal with the 
     composition of classes and objects, promoting a more flexible and efficient structure. Examples include, 
     - `Adapter:` Allowing incompatible interfaces to work together
     - `Facade:` Providing a simplified interface to a complex 
       system.
     - `Decorator:` Dynamically adding new functionality to 
       objects.
   - `Behavioral Patterns:` These patterns address how objects   
     interact and communicate, influencing the program's behavior. Examples include, 
     - `Observer:` establishing a one-to-many dependency between 
       objects.
     - `Strategy:` Allowing dynamic selection of an algorithm.
     - `Command:` Encapsulating a request as an object.
- By using design patterns, the following can be achieved.
  - `Write cleaner, more maintainable code:` Design patterns 
    promote a well-organized and modular code structure.
  - `Improve code reusability:` You can leverage existing patterns 
    across different parts of your code or even in new projects.
  - `Enhance communication with other developers:` Design patterns 
    provide a common language for discussing design decisions.
  - `Solve common problems efficiently:` By using established and 
    proven solutions, you can save time and effort.
